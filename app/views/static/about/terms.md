Terms of use can be complicated things.

We'll have a simple one up soon.

In the meantime, please be aware that our search page uses maps provided by the Ordnance Survey. Their terms and conditions can be found in Schedule 2 [here](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/licences/os-openspace-developer-agreement.html). Please respect them.
