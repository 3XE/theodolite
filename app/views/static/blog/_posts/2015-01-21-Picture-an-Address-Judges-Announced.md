The final line-up of judges for the [Picture an Address](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address) photography competition is announced today (Tuesday 20th January 2015). The competition coincides with the launch of what will become the country’s first address list to be published as open data, available for everyone to use without restriction. [Open Addresses UK](http://openaddressesuk.org/) contains information provided directly by people about addresses they know and from open data sources. Individuals and organisations are being asked to get involved by submitting data via the [Open Addresses UK website](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/).

Open Addresses UK depends on inspiring as many people and organisations as possible to take part.  A photography competition is now underway, inviting anyone, anywhere in the United Kingdom to enter. Participants are being challenged to *sum up, in a photograph, what an address means to them*. Whilst this could involve depicting their own homes, or a row of properties, people are being asked to think creatively and come up with more unusual and abstract ideas.

#### Judges

The winning entry will be decided by three high profile judges that have an interest in photography, science and data:

[Paul Clarke](http://paulclarke.com/)

Paul is one of London's busiest photographers, shooting a combination of event and portraiture commissions. He won the Professional category of 2014's Event Photographer of the Year competition, and leads a small team working on some of the UK's most interesting and exciting events. Before photography, he worked on technology and communication programmes in the public sector, and has had a long association with data and transparency, holding numerous executive and advisory positions in these areas.

[Roger Highfield](http://www.rogerhighfield.com/)

Roger was born in Wales, raised in north London and became the first person to bounce a neutron off a soap bubble. He was Science Editor of The Daily Telegraph for two decades and the Editor of the New Scientist between 2008 and 2011. Today, he is the Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum Group. Roger has written seven books and had thousands of articles published in newspapers and magazines.
