To ingest large quantities of addresses we use an open-source tool called Turbot. Turbot was originally conceived by the great team at [OpenCorporates](http://opencorporates.com/).

Our version of Turbot and all of the necessary documentation and instructions can be found at [http://turbot.openaddressesuk.org/](http://turbot.openaddressesuk.org/).

If you do choose to submit addresses in this way then please read and adhere to our [Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#subguidelines).
