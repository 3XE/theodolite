Last month, we launched our [Picture An Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address). We asked you to creatively capture, in one photograph, “what an address means to you”, offering the winning photographer £500 of photography vouchers.

It’s been an adventurous journey for our three [judges](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/21/Picture-an-Address-Judges-Announced), photographer [Paul Clarke](http://paulclarke.com/), Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum Group, [Roger Highfield](http://www.rogerhighfield.com/), and Director at Open Addresses UK [Jeni Tennison](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/team). The trio have sifted through a spellbinding pile of photography submissions that creatively depict representations of addresses across the UK and have made their decision. The Open Addresses UK photography competition winner will be crowned this week along with a selection of nominees that impressed the judges most - how exciting!

Keep your eyes peeled as we announce a set of nominees from Tuesday in the lead up to the winner announcement on Friday. Each nominee will be announced alongside a selection of similar submissions with a common theme. The central themes had no influence on the selection process but tell compelling stories about what makes us value an address.

#### Announcing the shortlist

* We will announce the five finalists and winner on Twitter at [@OpenAddressesUK](https://twitter.com/openaddressesuk) and the [website](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/) this week
* Our first shortlist announcement for the themes, “Natural Escapes” and “Architectural Diversity” will be published at Tuesday lunchtime
* On Wednesday afternoon we will announce the shortlists for themes “Through the Keyhole” and “Communities”
* On Thursday afternoon we will present the shortlist for our “Personal Monuments” and confirmation of finalists in line for the grand title
* Last but not least, at lunchtime on Friday we’ll announce the  “Picture an Address Open Addresses UK photography winner” who will receive their £500 of photography vouchers to spend as they wish!

#### Thanks to our entrants and judges

We’d like to say a huge thank you to all of our entrants for their inspiring and visionary photographs, eloquently capturing the very essence of addresses in the UK. A photograph can capture a thousand words and in this case the photographs submitted have provided a collective insight into the connections we have with addresses.

We’d also like to thank our amazing judges Paul Clarke, Roger Highfield, and Jeni Tennison for their dedication and time spent to decide a winning photograph that truly stood out amongst the rest. A great deal of deliberation, analysis and attention to detail was had, and we’re very pleased with the results. We hope you are too!

### Don’t forget to submit your address!

As a result of the photography competition we have had a selection of invaluable addresses willingly donated to us, now part of our ever-growing dataset of UK addresses. If you haven’t already we’d love you to [submit yours too](https://openaddressesuk.org). Every submission adds to an accurate and crowd-maintained infrastructure of open addresses available to all for free.

Wishing the best of luck to all entrants!
