> “there is a time for making addresses, and a time for going to bed”

*(with apologies to [Homer](http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.11.xi.html))*

People have been wondering why Open Addresses has been a little quiet recently.
We have been frequent [bloggers](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog) sharing what we learn, whilst we regularly published [new code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) for the platform and website. But we've had less to say over the past few weeks

Since Open Addresses has been in existence we have been on a journey to test two hypotheses:

<%= image_tag("blog/2015-07-23-hypotheses.png", alt: "Open Address Hypotheses") %>

*Hypotheses from [Open Addresses symposium](http://www.slideshare.net/theODI/open-addresses-symposium-slides-8th-august-2014)*

We did not want to fall in the middle ground between these two hypotheses. We, and the people who need better UK addresses, wanted a clear result.

Unfortunately, we have decided that the first hypothesis is true and that it is too high a risk for Open Addresses to continue on its current path.

This risk is generated by the [shades of grey that exist in open data](http://theodi.org/blog/shades-of-grey-in-open-data). The risk meant that we struggled to find someone that would be willing to provide Open Addresses with company insurance at an affordable level. To avoid this problem we tried to find services that would [both be useful and safely gather address data](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/04/16/better-addresses-2) but these would take a significantly longer time period before they became sustainable.  Unfortunately this was time that we didn't have under our current funding model. 

So, we have decided to go to sleep for a while.

This does not mean that the odyssey for UK open addresses is over.

Other people and organisations may discover new methods to safely gather addresses as open data, the complex copyright situation may get clarified or someone may choose to accept a greater level of risk. It may even be a different form of Open Addresses that takes one of these paths.

We do hope that someone chooses one of these routes, or any others that come to light. The [benefits](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/mission/benefits) of open addresses for users and the economy are significant. The need for open address data as a fundamental building block in the UK’s infrastructure will only grow over the coming years.

We would like to say thank you to all of those who helped. Many people and organisations helped whether it be telling us what they needed, providing us with funding and support, or sharing what they know about the complex worlds of UK copyright and UK addresses. The [blogs](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog) and [code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) that we developed as a result of this support remain open for anyone to use.

To wrap up Open Addresses we have produced and shared a report on the [lessons that we learned](http://theodi.org/case-studies/open-addresses-the-story-to-date). We would encourage people interested in open addresses for the UK, in copyright and in the larger topic of [data infrastructures](http://theodi.org/blog/where-next-for-data-infrastructure-work) to reflect on the lessons and learnings in the report.

If you have any questions then simply send in an [email](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org) and someone will pick it up.

Thank you for your support and goodnight. For now.
