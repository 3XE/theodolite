title: An Open Addresses Alpha
---

We are delighted that the Open Addresses Alpha release is now open for people to look at and provide comments on. We're proud of what we've achieved but we also want to hear what you think as we start on the next phase of Open Addresses.

So, have a look and give us your feedback. There are a few ways to do this:

1) At the top of every page is a Feedback button: simply click, type away and hit send
2) Start a discussion on the forum: [https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum)
3) Send an email to [info@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org)

Alternatively if you have spare time over the holiday season and want to contribute to some of the areas that we are working on, here are a few ideas:

1. Help add big open datasets 

Have a look at our [Adding Data page](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/addingdata) for what to do. Add new ideas, look in the depths of your 'digital drawers' at home or in your office for address data you own and have the right to share, new or old. Ask your friends and colleagues. Help us by making a Freedom Of Information request (FOI) to a public authority in the UK to see if we can use data containing addresses that they have released.

2. Design an application to use the Ingester API

We’re not accepting addresses into the live system yet, but it would be great to get some experience about how it could be used. How can it integrate into applications where people enter addresses – fast food delivery, mapping apps, shipping firms, housing associations – the list is endless. Can you design a game to make it fun to gather or maintain addresses? Do you have other ideas about crowd-sourcing addresses? 

3. Work out other ways to infer addresses

One of the things that we’ll be working on in the beta phase is inferring addresses based on other data, including addresses we already know, maps etc. We’ve got several ideas, but the more the better. If you can think of good approaches for inferring addresses then let us know; if you implement it we’ll aim to work with you to incorporate it.

4. Help with the website 

The GitHub repository for the website is [https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/theodolite](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/theodolite). What would you improve or change? Create a pull request!

5. Measure data quality 

The dataset is on the [Get the Data page](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/data). Why not download it and analyse its quality? We know coverage is limited as we could source our addresses from only one dataset (from Companies House), but we put lots of effort into cleaning up and normalising its data. Are you up to the challenge of finding those tricky addresses we got wrong?

We’ve been thinking about measures that will allow people to compare quality between different address products. We think these measures should be user-focussed, comparable, quantitative and transparent. The ideas for measures include coverage (should we compare the number of addresses in our database  against something independent like the number of households in the 2011 Census?); currency (or “freshness” to get less technical); time to process requests (how quickly is a new address made available for use?); and usage statistics (is an address higher quality because it is retrieved and used more often?). How would you define quality? Can you create running code?


We hope that you like what you see and have a great holiday and New Year


Best,
The Open Addresses Team
