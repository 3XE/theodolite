title: Data Enrichment
---

Download high-quality, well-structured address data in bulk to enrich other data sources.

This service is in **Alpha**.

Bulk data can be [downloaded through the site](/developers/download).

The bulk data can be used for many purposes:

+ To discover how many addresses are in a town
+ To determine the specific addresses within a given radius of a location
+ To help plan where to locate a new shop, a community broadband project or a new community centre
+ To link to other datasets to discover which local authority an address is in or the demographics of a given area

Why not let the [Open Addresses community](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum) know what you will use it for?

##### Implementation

Simply [download](/developers/download) the data and off you go!

If you want help using the data, want to share your ideas or want to ask the community a question then we would suggest either using the [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum) or dropping us an email to [info@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org).
