title: New Service Creation
---

Create innovative services with the use of our APIs or unique, persistent URLs for every town, postcode and address.

**Unique, persistent identifiers**

Our unique persistent identifier for each address creates opportunities for new services to emerge.

The most widely discussed example of such a new service is to store delivery instructions for individual addresses (“the house is at the end of the lane just past the farm”) or even allow people to say where and how they like physical goods to be delivered (“drop parcels in the shed at the back and call Peter on 123”). Such delivery instructions could be stored once but used by any delivery firm.

A more future-looking example would be drone delivery (“to deliver to address [A] land at point {X, Y, Z} after following flight-path {D >E > F > G}”). We are sure you can think of many others.

**APIs**

All of the services in this section have been are built from publicly available, [open-source](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) [APIs](/developers/apis-and-data) that the Open Addresses platform supports. If a feature is missing you can contribute to the development of the code for the APIs or make a feature on the [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum).

The APIs can be combined in many different ways or even mixed with services provided by other organisations, for examples maps from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) or [Google’s Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/geolocation/).

##### Demonstration

Have you built a service based on Open Addresses APIs? Let us know if you want us to link to it here.

##### Implementation

Implementing a new service is up to you.

Find out more about our APIs and URLs in the [Developer section](/developers/apis-and-data) of the site.

If you want our help in creating a new service, want to share your ideas or want to ask the community a question then we would suggest either using the [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum) or dropping us an email to [info@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org).
