We host our [forums on Github](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum), do ask us and the wider community questions if you need help with any aspects of the platform.

All of our [code is open-source](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) and our [roadmap](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/) is also open.

If you want to assist us by contributing to a roadmap issue then we regularly [tag issues that the community can help us with](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/labels/can%20be%20done%20by%20community).

If you see something that isn't tagged but that you can help with do feel free to ask us by [email](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org) or on the forums, we may be being overly cautious.
