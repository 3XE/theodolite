We’d love to hear your views on how this guide can be improved. Send your suggestion directly to [info@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org).

## Adding an individual address

No technical skills? Just go [here](/get-involved/add-an-address) and write it in the form. Don't worry about the address format: our APIs will take care of it. Remember to read the submission guidelines.

Want to see how our API handles different addresses formats? Go to our technical demonstration [here](https://sorting-office.openaddressesuk.org/), don't forget to click the "contribute" box.

## Adding multiple addresses

Our API page [describes](/developers/apis-and-data#submitmany) the services that can allow you to do this. Please remember to read the submission guidelines.

## I work for a local authority that wants to contribute new addresses

Local authorities are in a unique position for new *build* addresses, i.e. addresses that are newly built and that no-one has seen before.

These new build addresses can be safely released at the right point in the process. We have written a [blog](/blog/2015/03/31/better-addresses-new-addresses) on our investigations into these processes and how publishing new build addresses as open data can improve resident's lives.

A local authority may also be able to contribute through other means so do read the other sections.

## I work for an organisation that wants to contribute addresses

Great! This will help make UK addresses better for everyone.

We publish addresses as open data under the [Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Do check that your organisation is comfortable with this.

The next step is to check that your address data does not contain third party rights that you are not authorised to release under an open data licence. 

The legal situation is complex but according to the opinion that we have received, there are three types of activity that may create a third-party right:

+ Copying the entirety, or a subset, of a third-party owned dataset to form the basis of a dataset
+ Taking an existing list of addresses and correcting them based on information from a third-party owned dataset
+ Using a third-party owned dataset to add a field containing a linked identifier

If your address data is produced using one of these activities then you may want to check with your legal department and contact any third parties who supply you with address services to determine if they will authorise you to release the data under an open data licence.

Once you have determined that this check is unnecessary, or have received confirmation that you can publish the data, then if you wish to contribute bulk addresses follow the process described [here](/developers/apis-and-data#submitmany).

Alternatively if you wish to implement a more detailed level of integration then our services and APIs will allow to you to contribute addresses whilst benefitting from the services that the Open Addresses platform supports.

## I work for an organisation that wants to contribute historic addresses

Fantastic! Our [confidence algorithm and API](developers/apis-and-data#confidence) can cater for the age of historic data, this is necessary as some addresses may have changed since your organisation last saw them.

We publish addresses as open data under the [Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). First, check that your organisation is comfortable with this.

The next step is to check that your historic addresses do not contain third party rights that you are not authorised to release under an open data licence. 

The legal situation is complex but according to the opinion that we have received, there are three types of activity that may create a third-party right:

+ Copying the entirety, or a subset, of a third-party owned dataset to form the basis of a dataset
+ Taking an existing list of addresses and correcting them based on information from a third-party owned dataset
+ Using a third-party owned dataset to add a field containing a linked identifier

If you know that your historic addresses were produced using one of these activities then you may want to check with your  legal department and contact any third parties who supplied you with address services to determine if they will authorise you to release the data under an open data licence.

If you determine that there are no third party rights or once you have received this confirmation then you can contribute historic bulk address data through the process described [here](/developers/apis-and-data#submitmany).

## I want to help source data from organisations

Great!

We have set up a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UXqgc1wy/datasets) to allow people to debate ideas, share the workload, and minimise duplication of effort.

The Trello board allows people to work together on datasets, for example some may be present in each of the UK’s 433 local authorities and hence sourcing the dataset may need 433 Freedom of Information requests to verify whether or not third-party IP is present or 433 visits to different open data platforms to download the data.

The board contains a set of Read Me guidelines to help people along. These will evolve as everyone works together to develop good working practices.

You can choose to participate at different parts of the process based on your skillsets of preference: for example adding ideas, submitting Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, verifying Intellectual Property (IP) rights or loading data which is approved as good to go.

Roll your sleeves up and get stuck in :)

## What to do if you believe your IP is being infringed

If we do receive any complaints regarding third-party IP then we will follow our takedown process.

If you believe your IP is being infringed then please [report the infringement](/about/reportaninfringement).
