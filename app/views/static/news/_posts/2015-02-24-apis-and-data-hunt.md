title: Open Addresses launches APIs and hunts for new data at Open Data Camp
---

[Open Addresses UK](https://openaddressesuk.org/) sponsored [Open Data Camp 2015](http://odcamp.org.uk/) this weekend (February 21st and 22nd) in Winchester. The event coincided with [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/), a global series of events and hackathons. 

At the event, our team unveiled [an initial set of Open Addresses APIs](/about/apidocu) and discussed the sorts of tools and services that the platform enables. These include  improvements to existing services; new tools to help users maintain the platform; or new services built using the data and APIs that Open Addresses publishes. We also started building a few new APIs during the event so keep an eye out for an announcement about our exciting “building block APIs” that are comming soon...

The team called on delegates at the ‘unconference’ to provide feedback on the current release of our services. Amongst other items those attending were encouraged to review and suggest improvements to the new [inference algorithm](https://github.com/theodi/shared/issues/504#issuecomment-72818881) that will enable the discovery of new addresses from current, incomplete information, and is predicted to boost the number of addresses on the database by 350%. The team also sought feedback on a new [confidence feature](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) that will measure trust in our address data.

We also shared and debated many of the challenges we've faced such as collaborative maintenance, privacy, provenance tracking and how to grow a subset of an infrastructure dataset into the whole thing. Many of the attendees faced similar challenges so it was great to work and learn together as we all discussed how to solve them.

As well as urging the audience to directly contribute addresses, the Open Addresses UK team encouraged people to take part in our [Crowdsourcing Challenge](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/22/crowdsourcing-challenge) with a prize of £40,000. The Challenge is looking for creative and innovative ideas that will either bring in more addresses or correct and add information to existing ones. The winner could be anything from a smartphone app, to a website, or even a new device. The deadline for bids is this Thursday (26th February). (The first bid is already in so don’t miss out!)

We ended the event with our notebooks full of a whole range of follow-on requests including demonstrations of the service to local authorities; supporting hack/challenge events and conferences; new features for our roadmap; and interviews with journalists. It will be challenging to fit all of that it in with everything that is already planned but we have broad backs, a big problem to solve and a great team, so off we go!

Finally, we also made time for a bit of fun. You can read about the trials and tribulations of our lego man at ODCamp on [Storify](https://storify.com/openaddressesuk/the-journey-of-an-open-addresses-legoman).
