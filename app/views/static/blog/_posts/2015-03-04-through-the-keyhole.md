title: Picture An Address - Through the Keyhole Shortlist
---

Today is the second round of our [Picture an Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address) shortlist announcements, and our next selection of photographs presents addresses ‘Through the keyhole’. 

The UK is renowned for its reticent and polite culture. We consciously respect an individual’s personal space in social engagements, their down-time at home and environmental space at work. Lets face it, we’re unintrusive and extremely well-mannered, but our inquisitiveness sparks imaginative conceptions of how others reside in their homes. This shortlist plays on our inquisitiveness and paints a picture of homes behind the address.

Many take pride in making a home their own, however in contrast statistics show [54.1%](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/333023/FA4131_length_of_residence_of_household_reference_person_by_tenure.xls) of the population change address every 10 years or less. We’re becoming more travel-centric and less location possessive, allowing us to experience a wider variety of addresses in a lifetime.

So we’ll leave you with this question: what makes and address important to you?
