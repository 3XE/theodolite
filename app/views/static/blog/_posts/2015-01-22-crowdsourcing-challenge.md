Addresses are [woven into the fabric of our national infrastructure](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeni-tennison/a-brief-history-of-open-a_b_6485628.html). They connect us to the wider world and help us to access a huge network of services.

Open Addresses UK is a startup that is bringing together data about the places we live, work and visit and making it available for everyone. Our initial [funding is provided by the Cabinet Office’s Release of Data Fund](http://theodi.org/news/383k-government-grant-released-to-create-uk-open-address-list). 

Our [vision](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/vision) is to create and publish an open data dataset of all UK addresses, one that everyone can use. This will make it easy for people to find, link and combine address data with other data. They might use it for any purpose: analysis and research; building public services or creating new businesses; from making existing products more efficient to building new, innovative ideas.

Our addresses come from four main sources:

+ address data that is published under an open licence; 
+ address data that organisations contribute to us through our APIs;
+ address data that members of the public contribute through our website; and
+ addresses inferred from other reference data, open datasets and the addresses created by the above methods.

We are building a platform which imports this data, tracks provenance, performs inference, determines statistical confidence and publishes the resulting dataset as open data.

Each address in the dataset will be published with supporting information including:

+ provenance - e.g. “derived from Companies House data using the software component at [URL]”; “inferred from address X and Y using the software component at [URL]”; “contributed through the website”; “all of the above”
+ confidence - e.g. Green, Amber, Red or a percentage, to indicate how confident we are that the address record is accurate; and
+ attribution - e.g. “contribution by anonymous member of the public”
We have [publicly released an Alpha version](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/news/2015/01/14/UKs-first-open-and-free-address-list-launches) of the dataset and platform and are now developing a Beta release.

#### Scope of Work

We are looking for a partner to design and deliver an exemplar service that large numbers of people can and will use to contribute to the Open Addresses UK platform. This exemplar service will form part of our collaborative model to maintain the data in the platform.

We are looking for creative and innovative ideas that will either bring in more addresses or correct and add information to the ones we have.

This service could be anything: a smartphone app, a website, or even a new device. It could be a game, or a more conventional application. It could collect new addresses we do not know about, fix wrong addresses or add more confidence to addresses created by statistical inference. Address collection or correction could even be a side effect to some other product or service people use (think of [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html#creation-of-value)).

If your service idea is focussed on collecting new addresses then it should encourage the right behaviour from the crowd that use the service, focussing them towards areas where coverage is sparse and more addresses are needed. Alternatively if your service if focussed on correcting or adding confidence to existing addresses then it will require different user behaviour to be successful. 

But, fundamentally, this service needs to encourage large numbers of people to add value (as measured by number of addresses, or confidence in existing addresses) to the data published by the platform. That will be how we and our chosen partner measure success.

The new service will hook into our [APIs](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/theodolite) and contribute to the collection of addresses alongside our other sources. We operate in an agile fashion with fortnightly sprints, by the time this new service is designed and developed our [aim](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/) is to have developed these APIs to support the following capabilities:

+ search for an address
+ add an address
+ report that an address is good
+ report that an address does not exist
+ report that an address record has issues

The API to add an address will optionally perform validation to ensure that data is well-formed and matches with the reference data, such as lists of place names and postcodes, that has been loaded into the platform.

There are many other useful open data sources (like maps or photographs) that exist and could also be integrated into the new service to increase the volume and quality of the addresses that people submit. You are free to do so, subject to the right licence. Copyright law is complex but, for example, third party IPR can “pollute” an open data source if the dataset is validated or corrected against third-party data, making what was originally open data unusable.  It is essential that the resulting Open Addresses UK dataset is open data, and can be published under the [CC-BY-4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

More than [20 million people in the UK play mobile games every month](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/The-UK-Mobile-Gaming-Landscape): can you build a service that get at least half of them to submit, fix or add information to even just 1 new address? Come on, how hard can it be?

#### Proposals

We have reserved £40,000 of our budget for this challenge.
In your proposal to build this service we would like to see:

+ A vision for your new service including how it would be promoted to the public
+ Estimated take up rates for the service (volume of users, volume of new/changed addresses)
+ High-level timescales for implementation
+ What you will need from our team to support your work during the design and development of the service
+ How you see the service operating after launch
+ Proposed method to ensure that payment is based on Open Addresses UK publishing additional high confidence addresses as a result of this service

We will follow the same [procurement policy](http://theodi.org/procurement) as the Open Data Institute.

#### Timescales 

+ Publication of this document: Thursday 22 January
+ Deadline for questions: Thursday 12 February
+ Deadline for proposals: Thursday 19 February
+ Negotiations
+ Confirmation of successful bidder: Thursday 12 March

#### Summary 

This is an exciting opportunity to be part of an innovative exercise that will creates the UK’s first open list of addresses. It would be great if we could work together to achieve that vision.
