<div class="content-meta">Article by Patrice John-Baptiste, on 4th March '15</div>

Today marks the second round of our [Picture an Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address) shortlist announcements, and the next selection of photographs reveal addresses ‘Through the keyhole’.

As UK citizens we’re renowned for our reticent and polite culture. We conscientiously respect an individual’s personal space in social engagements, the working environment and down-time at home. However, our inquisitive nature sparks intrigue into what life is like inside of an address. This shortlist attempts to familiarise the addresses we long to explore.

Many of us take pride in making an address a personal place to settle in for life. However, statistics show we’re now becoming more travel-centric and less location possessive. Over half ([54.1%](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/333023/FA4131_length_of_residence_of_household_reference_person_by_tenure.xls)) of the population changes address every 10 years or less, and in time this may redefine how we perceive the places we call home.

#### The shortlist for this theme is…

A huge thank you to talented photographers Jacquetta, Helena Fawcett, Jenny Stirling and Marianne Mosley for their exploration of an address.

#### Congratulations to the finalist…
