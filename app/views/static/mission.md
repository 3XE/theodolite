		<p>Making UK address data better for everyone.</p>

</div>

Addresses are part of our everyday lives. They are where we live, work and visit, connecting us to local communities and services we rely on. There is a hidden complexity and cost in the process of locating addresses, entering addresses online, and  accessing an accurate address list. We’re here to change this, to make things simpler and better.

Together with a growing network of contributors we’re building the nation’s first free and open address list, available for anyone to use and share as open data.

We’re creating accessible services that meet the needs of the public sector, organisations and most importantly, meet the needs of the people and communities who live and work at UK addresses. Since launching our Alpha services in January 2015 we have begun to unlock the full potential of an open address list. We have seen heightened demand amongst local authorities, organisations and people; we have shaped our services as a response to their valuable feedback.

Address services available today can be expensive to use, many organisations simply can’t afford them. Meanwhile the quality is inconsistent, it can take months to make new addresses visible leaving [the people who live or work there unable to get the services they need](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/09/living-breathing-problem).

Open Addresses will provide high quality data that is both affordable and sustainable. It will make UK address data better for everyone.

#### Building an open and collaborative culture

Collaboration and openness is the core of everything we do. We are open by default. Our [source code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) and [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/issues)  are open and we invite everyone to contribute, use and [share feedback](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum). 

With the help of this growing community we are building a collaborative model to maintain quality address data.

#### Raising confidence in address data 

We understand the importance of having accurate addresses and track where our address data comes from. We openly publish a calculated [level of confidence for each address](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) so others can make informed decisions about the addresses they choose to use.

We believe that we are the first open data organisation to start by tracking provenance and publishing confidence. We know that UK address data is part of a complex legal and copyright puzzle so need to publish [address data that is safe to use](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/26/making-address-data-safe).

#### Maintaining a public good

We believe addreses are a fundamental part of the [UK’s National Information Infrastructure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure/national-information-infrastructure ) and should be open for all to benefit from and contribute to.

Everyone who uses Open Addresses’ services, or who uses services that are built on top of the Open Addresses platform, becomes part of this community. When people and service providers use the services it allows the platform to learn about bad data, to learn how much to [trust addresses](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) or to discover new addresses.  This approach reduces costs and improves data quality. It helps turn what was an expensively maintained asset into a [public good](http://www.slideshare.net/JeniT/bcs-address-day-open-addresses-jeni-tennison) that is maintained using collaboration, cross-subsidy and voluntary effort.

#### Overcoming new challenges 

There’s still much to do.

We'd like to expand our current services and develop new ones, increase our address list, sign up new trialists, grow our community and secure further sponsorship to bring our services into Beta.

Open Addresses is wholly owned by the not-for-profit [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/). We have to create revenues and sponsorship to sustain our operations but will always make the bulk address data available to download in full, for free as open data.

#### Let’s make history

There is a [rich history](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeni-tennison/a-brief-history-of-open-a_b_6485628.html?) of addresses in the UK. Together lets write the next chapter.
