title: Better addresses: “It’s what our residents need”
---

Over the last few months we’ve been talking to various public sector organisations, both central government and local authorities, around the country.

There has been a great reaction from the public sector to the benefits that Open Addresses can bring:

making new addresses available faster so that the people who live or work at those addresses can receive better services
creating open data that is safe for everyone to use, from the smallest local charity to the largest private sector company
helping to build digital services that better meet user needs and improve user experience

This is the first of a blog series focussing on how Open Addresses can help the public sector provide better services. In this blog we investigate common issues with new addresses and how Open Addresses can help.

Making new addresses available faster

We’ve already written a blogpost on the human impact caused by the current legacy approach to creating and publishing new addresses. These issues are caused for every new house and every new office block.

Over the last few weeks we have learnt more about how much these issues are costing people, businesses and local authorities.

The delay in making new addresses available to the right people creates effort for a wide network of organisations: local authorities, utility companies (for example water or gas), Internet providers and online shopping. These organisations end up working together with the people at these new addresses as they attempt to overcome the challenges and make the address available to use. The root cause is the legacy processes that are used to publish new addresses, but the cost and wasted time just keeps on stacking up.

As part of our mission to improve addresses in the UK we have investigated these.. We wanted to discover whether and where in the process it would be legally safe for the address data to be made open data. We want to make address data that is safe for everyone to use.

At the simplest level if a property is being built that requires a new address the local authority should be be notified by the property developer. The local authority then manages a process to create the new address and make it available.

Sometime the property developer will request a specific address (possibly including a postcode) and in other cases the local authority will suggest an address. The new address request is negotiated between the property developer and local authority staff.

Once both parties are happy then the local authority staff will pass the data to other organisations, such as Geoplace and Royal Mail, for further negotiation and processing. Those organisations may claim rights over the data after they process it, even for a single address. They may object to an address record that they have processed being released as open data, this creates a legal risk. 

New addresses are open data

But passing Open Addresses a copy of a new address once it has been checked by local authority staff and *before* it is passed to other organisations does not create any copyright infringement issues. There is no mechanical copying of data before this step; address data provided by property developers is simply manually validated., If the local authority wishes to publish it as open data it can do so, it would be safe for anyone to use.

So, for a local authority to help solve the problems that people experience in new addresses they, or their software suppliers, simply need to automate a process to send Open Addresses a copy of a new address either before or at the same time as they pass it to other organisations.

We will then publish the address as open data.

The new addresses will be published through our linked data (URLs), through our web services (APIs), or from the bulk download. Anyone can use the data to discover new addresses

How to publish new addresses

If a local authority wants to publish new addresses singly our Sorting Office API allows easy input of single addresses. If they prefer to input  a batch of addresses our Turbot ETL engine will be simplest. 

As we receive the data we will apply a confidence factor to give clarity on how much people can trust the address.  This step is necessary as there is always a chance that the address may change between being passed to Open Addresses and the property build completing. If this occurs then our collaborative maintenance model will pick up the change as the address is used.

If you need help with loading new addresses, or simply want others to know new addresses in your area being published as open data, then contact us on our forums.

“It’s what our residents need”

Finally, this blogpost is titled “it’s what our residents need”.

This is  simply part of a quote from an address management department we spoke to at a local authority. We think it’s worth putting the quote in full:

“The more people and services that know addresses faster the better. It’s what our residents need. Can you let us know when we can start sending you our addresses?”

As this post explains the answer is pretty simple.

You can send us addresses now.
