Open Addresses UK calls on individuals and companies to donate information

Officially launched today, [openaddressesuk.org](https://www.openaddressesuk.org) brings together data about the places where people live, work and visit. In time, it will become the first UK address list published as open data and available for everyone to use without restriction. The list will combine information from existing open data sources with material provided directly by people about the addresses that they know. The platform already publishes 1 million addresses. Individuals and organisations are now being asked to get involved by submitting data via the [Open Addresses UK website](https://www.openaddressesuk.org).

There are existing address files in the UK but they tend to charge a fee, require a license or are incomplete. Open Addresses UK’s fundamental commitment is to produce a free, open list that will allow people to focus on using the data, rather than having to think about whether they can afford to do it, or are allowed to do what they want with it. People wanting to use the dataset will be able to download the whole list (a “bulk download”) or access specific parts for their own individual needs. The data collected and maintained by Open Addresses UK will always be available in full, without restrictions, as open data.

In time additional features will enable users to:

+ submit new addresses, either singly or in bulk
+ validate and correct addresses
+ look up address locations

#### Why the UK needs open addresses

The need for a free, open address database has been well documented within Open Data User Group ([ODUG](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/open-data-user-group)) business cases and in the [recent report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274979/bis-14-513-open-national-address-gazetteer.pdf) on an Open Address Gazetteer, written for the UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Its many benefits could include:

Enabling construction companies and owners of new properties to quickly register postal addresses so that they become immediately identifiable to essential (utilities, emergency services) and non-essential (retailers, fast-food) suppliers.
Allowing start-up companies and developers access to data which, when combined with and linked to other open data sets will allow for the development of new goods and services. In Denmark, it’s been estimated that opening up address data created €14m of economic value in 2010 ([source](http://www.slideshare.net/Mortlin/addresses-and-address-data-experiences-from-denmark))

Open Addresses UK Director Jeni Tennison said:  “Addresses are an essential part of our national infrastructure. They connect us to wider society and help us to access services. Everyone needs to be able to use addresses freely, which means they need to be open. We want to make UK addresses easier for people to find and combine with other data. We want as many people as possible to collaborate with us to create what we hope will be the definitive open database of addresses in the United Kingdom. Our aim is to ensure address data is both accurate and openly available.” 

#### Photo Competition 

To promote the new database and encourage people to donate addresses for inclusion, Open Addresses UK is launching a photography competition, highlighting the rich diversity of locations across the UK. People are being asked to submit original photographs of addresses that will then be used to illustrate the work of Open Addresses UK and will be promoted across digital and social media channels. The competition will be judged by a panel including renowned photographer [Paul Clarke](http://paulclarke.com/photography/).

It is open to anyone and more information is available on the [Open Addresses UK website](/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address).
