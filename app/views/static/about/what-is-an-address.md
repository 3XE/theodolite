title: What is an address?
---

An address pinpoints the places where we live, work and visit. Addresses are part of our everyday lives, connecting us to local communities and services we rely on.

##An open address list

Addresses are currently a closed asset owned and controlled by private and public sector institutions. Open Addresses is building an open data address list that anyone can access, use, contribute to and share.

The address list is simply a list of places and does not contain any names or personal information.

##Addressing needs

Addresses date back hundreds of years and have evolved over time as the needs of society change. From identifying parish districts to aiding geolocation services, there are a variety of address types in use today that make it easier for us to go about our daily lives.

Residential and business properties require a postal address (add link to glossary) to deliver post. Parks, bridges, schools, cashpoints, registered companies, even public toilets and monuments also have an address. In some cases the law requires it and in others addresses are useful for service maintenance.

The are multiple types of address to suit different needs. For example:

* airlines and satellites use latitude and longitude coordinates to pinpoint locations from the earth’s atmosphere
* mobile masts have location numbers used by telephone networks
* highway marker posts help public and emergency services pinpoint locations on the motorway
* Ordnance Survey’s Unique Property Reference Numbers ([UPRNs](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/news/2015/04/20/bcs-press-release)) for linked data
* administrative addresses
* postal addresses addresses in multiple languages.

You can read more about some of these in our [alternative addresses](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/04/28/better-addresses-3) blog post.

##The structure of an address

A postal address often uses a [standard structure](https://sorting-office.openaddressesuk.org/). This structure can vary and usually looks like:

* Flat number/ unit - number of the unit within the property
* House number/ building name - number or name of the building 
* Street - the street where the building resides
* Locality - a smaller area than a post town
* Postal / Administrative Town - the post town where a postal sorting office is located, often the town or city
* Postcode - required for the Royal Mail to deliver to the address

The [postcode](http://www.royalmail.com/delivery/mail-advice/postcodes-addresses-explained&quot%3B&gt%3B) designed to help with the delivery of post. A postcode consists of a combination of letters and numbers (*SW1 3TB*). The first part identifies the area of the sorting office (*SW*) and delivery office district (*1*), whilst the second part identifies the address’ local area or neighbourhood (*3*) and (*TB*) determines the address postal route.

We currently record addresses using a machine readable version of this structure in our [platform](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/developers/docs). This structure is known as [BS7666](http://www.iahub.net/docs/1183553456634.pdf), a British standard for addresses.

The BS7666 structure has its limitations. BS7666 describes spatial addresses, however is not designed for other addressing needs. In the future we will work towards creating a more flexible and extensible format that can support different needs. Let us know what future address formats you would like to see.
