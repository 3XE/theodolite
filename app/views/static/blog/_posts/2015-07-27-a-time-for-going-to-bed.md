> “there is a time for making addresses, and a time for going to bed”

*(with apologies to [Homer](http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.11.xi.html))*

People have been wondering why Open Addresses has been a little quiet recently.
We have been frequent [bloggers](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog) sharing what we learn, whilst we regularly published [new code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) for the platform and website. But we've had less to say over the past few weeks. Here’s why.

Since Open Addresses has been in existence we have been on a journey to test two hypotheses:

<%= image_tag("blog/2015-07-27-hypotheses.png", alt: "Open Address Hypotheses") %>

*Hypotheses from [Open Addresses symposium](http://www.slideshare.net/theODI/open-addresses-symposium-slides-8th-august-2014)*


We discovered that both hypotheses were true.

The first hypothesis creates the [shades of grey that exist in open data](http://theodi.org/blog/shades-of-grey-in-open-data).

To avoid these shades, and the legal risks that they cause, we looked for [alternative techniques](/blog/2015/02/12/inference) and services that would both be [useful and safely gather](/blog/2015/04/16/better-addresses-2) address data. Testing these services with users and customers led us to conclude that the second hypothesis was also true.

This has given us a better idea about the time and investment it will take to get to something approaching completeness and sustainability. Unfortunately, this was time and investment that we did not have: the end date of our [initial funding](http://theodi.org/news/383k-government-grant-released-to-create-uk-open-address-list) was fixed. The original bid contained a nine-month
development plan, with one month for discovery and eight for alpha and beta
development. The discovery phase was delivered within a month, but delays in
the sign-off of the remaining grant meant that alpha and beta development was
compressed into five months.

So, we have decided to hibernate for a while.

This does not mean that the odyssey for UK open addresses is over.

We may discover new and faster methods to safely gather addresses as open data. The shades of grey may become black and white. Someone may choose to provide more funding. It may be Open Addresses or someone else that takes one of these paths.

We do hope that this happens. The [benefits](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/mission/benefits) of open addresses for users and the economy are significant. The need for open address data as a fundamental building block in the UK’s data infrastructure will only grow over the coming years.

But for now we need to reduce our activity to a minimum level.

Before we hibernate we would like to say thank you to all of those who have helped so far. Many people and organisations helped whether it be telling us what they needed, providing us with funding and support, or sharing what they know about the complex worlds of UK copyright and UK addresses.

The [blogs](/blog) and [services](/services/services-overview) that we developed as a result of this support remain open for anyone to use. The [code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK)  is open in case anyone wishes to contribute to it. We will continue to monitor these channels.

To wrap up Open Addresses we have produced and shared a report on the [lessons that we learned](http://theodi.org/case-studies/open-addresses-the-story-to-date). We would encourage people interested in open addresses for the UK, in copyright and in the larger topic of [data infrastructures](http://theodi.org/blog/where-next-for-data-infrastructure-work) to reflect on the thoughts in the report.

If you have any questions then simply send an [email](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org) and someone will pick it up.

Thank you for your support and we hope to see you again soon.
