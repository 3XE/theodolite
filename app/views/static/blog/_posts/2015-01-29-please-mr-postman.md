title: Please Mr Postman, No More Junk!

In a recent discussion on [Slashdot](http://search.slashdot.org/story/15/01/15/1447259/first-crowdsourced-open-data-address-list-launches-in-the-uk), one contributor reflected on how delighted they would be if the volume of unsolicited post received at home were to increase: “by soaking shredded junk mail I can then use a cheap briquette press to give me free winter fuel” mused an Anonymous Coward with, we suspect, his or her tongue only partially in their cheek.

It’s fair to say that this is a minority view and over the past couple of weeks, we’ve had more than a few folk tell us that they are concerned by the possibility that Open Addresses UK might provide “carte blanche” to direct marketers.

**We are confident that this will not be the case and here are the reasons why**

There are lots of methods that junk mailers use to target the unsuspecting public but most of them boil down to one of two things:

1. They post fully addressed mail, including the householder’s name or;
2. They post things “to the householder” (ie. without a name) 

In order to do the first of these, the sender of the mail will buy a list of addresses from a marketing company. In many instances, this is supplemented with data that reveals additional details about the household: socio-economic, or consumption information, for example. It is unlikely that the Open Addresses UK list (with no names) will disrupt or change this market, as companies that wish to target named individuals will continue to do so, buying existing datasets that include names. Sadly, we don’t have the power to reduce the amount of junk mail that people receive in this way but neither will we increase it.

The second method (above) is more interesting. A spammer's options for doing “to the householder" mailouts are i) to use local door-to-door delivery (someone walking the streets posting the mailshots through letterboxes without the aid of an address file), or ii) to use the Royal Mail whose posties can do it on their rounds. The Royal Mail offers discounted/bulk pricing for posting volumes of  letters using their address file, it is optimised for postal delivery and the order that the posties walk their rounds. This is not something that we  do. We’re in the address business, not the postal business!

**So how do the junk mailers get their hands on our personal data in the first place - and what difference will our open address list make?**

The fact is that organisations are already buying and selling reams of personal data. Hundreds of thousands of names and addresses are sold every year by local councils to direct marketing companies because of legislation that compels them to sell the Electoral Roll to anyone who asks. There are two versions of the roll: one that is used for official purposes (and which is not available for sale) and; one that can be sold to companies or individuals who are interested in peoples’ names and addresses. Everyone has the right to be taken off the public version (a simple email to the local council is all that’s required). Even though individuals have the ability to opt out of the public version in this way, the Local Government Association [is currently calling for limits to be applied to how the Electoral Roll is sold and who can buy it](http://www.local.gov.uk/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10180/6465522/NEWS).

It’s not just about junk mail, of course. In some cases, government agencies have been accused of selling names and addresses to private companies for financial gain. Most recently, the DVLA has become the subject of a [campaign](http://challengethefine.com/) which claims that to-date, it has sold 12m names and addresses to parking firms which then attempt to levy charges and fines against motorists.

The interesting thing about these examples is that they are going on right now and they involve the sale of data which is quite clearly personal data. The vendors are selling names as well as addresses. 

Open Addresses UK does not want to receive personal data. Our published data is devoid of any identifiers that could link it to an individual, and our guidelines ask people not to send it to us. 

All the guidelines, code and data are [open](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/) so anyone can check. There’s always the risk that someone - either mistakenly or maliciously - submits personal data alongside the addresses. Due to our fundamentally open approach both Open Addresses and the community around it will be able to see if that happens, and intervene to stop it. 
 
The reality is that we are interested in addresses, places, locations. Not in the people who live, work or go about their business there. 

As for junk mail, the reality is that the most reliable way to prevent getting it is to register with the [Mailing Preference Service](http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/mpsr/) (MPS). Members of the Direct Marketing Association should not send you mail, wherever they get your address from, if you are on that list. 

In the interests of keeping warm this winter, we suspect that the Anonymous Coward is unlikely to be registering with the MPS anytime soon!
