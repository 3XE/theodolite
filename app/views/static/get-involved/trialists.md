title: Trialists
---

We develop our platform and services openly, based on our own research and [feedback](https://github.com/OpenAddressesuk/forum) from service providers and users. That is how we can best meet your needs.

Anyone can use the APIs and services but we will shortly be launching a more formal trialist programme.

This programme is suited to people and organisations who are willing to invest time to work with us as we develop Alpha and Beta services by testing the services as part of their own product and service development roadmaps.

We will contact trialists on a fortnightly basis to ask them detailed questions on their use of the services and bring trialists together for a bimonthly meeting to discuss Open Addresses.

If you wish to join this programme please contact us at [trialists@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:trialists@openaddressesuk.org).
