We have named our address parsing API the 'Sorting Office'.

We use this API in the [add an address page](/get-involved/add-an-address) on our own website. It removes the need for a user to know how their address is structured, instead we do the hard work for them. Every address that is entered helps us [learn more](/blog/2015/01/23/give-our-sorting-office-a-try) about UK addresses. 

Sorting Office takes a free-format text string and returns the address decomposed into building blocks (street name, locality, town, postcode...), along with any other information that we already hold about the address.

Sorting Office can simultaneously submit addresses to the platform by setting the 'Contribute' argument described in the documentation: [https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#how-to-use](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#how-to-use).

By submitting addresses you, or your organisation become part of our collaborative model from which every user benefts. 

If you do choose to submit addresses in this way then please read and adhere to the [Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#subguidelines) and ensure that your site's terms and conditions provide appropriate information to your users.

Detailed documentation for this API can be found at [https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office).

A technical demonstration of the API can be found at [https://sorting-office.openaddressesuk.org/](https://sorting-office.openaddressesuk.org/).
