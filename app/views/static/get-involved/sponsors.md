<h2 id='benefits'>Benefits</h2>
 
**Social and economic value** - one other country, Denmark, has successfully managed to release their address data as open data. A [study]( http://www.epsiplatform.eu/content/value-danish-address-data#sthash.66jSkCtU.dpuf) in 2010 determined that this created yearly economic and social value of €14 million. If this figure scales in proportion to the population of the country then the UK can expect to see £110 million a year of social and economic value.
 
**More people can get access to address data** – many organisations cannot afford to use address data at the moment. In Denmark releasing address data as open data led to a 1000% increase in the number of organisations using accurate address data.
 
**Higher speed and quality**  - over the last decade the UK has averaged 130,000 new homes every year. It can take months before those new addresses are published and visible so that the people who live or work there can [access the services they need](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/09/living-breathing-problem). By fixing this issue we will improve service delivery and improve people’s lives.
 
**New service creation** – our unique, persistent identifiers will easily allow new services to be created that authoritatively link to addresses. The easiest example of such a new service is a service to store delivery instructions and allows people to say where and how they like physical goods to be delivered (“drop parcels in the shed at the back”, “the house is at the end of the lane just past the farm”). A more future-looking example would be drone delivery (“to deliver to address [A] land at point {X, Y, Z} after following flight-path {D >E > F > G}”).
 
**Innovation and thought leadership** – We believe that we are the first open data organisation to start tracking provenance and determining confidence in the data that we publish and are developing and learning new techniques as we go. Meanwhile our approach to building a comprehensive address list from a sparse set of components will be replicable to other countries and may be replicable to other parts of our [National Information Infrastructure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure/national-information-infrastructure )
