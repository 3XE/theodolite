title: UK’s first open and free address list launches
---

[Open Addresses UK](https://openaddressesuk.org) has announced that it will be sponsoring [Open Data Camp 2015](http://odcamp.org.uk/) on February 21st and 22nd in Winchester. The event coincides with [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/), a global series of events where people get together to 'write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments.'

At the event the Open Addresses UK team will show and debate the next stages of their work including: methods to create addresses through inference, how to measure confidence in address data, and the APIs that are being built to allow people to both submit addresses and use the data published by the open addresses platform to build new services.

Open Addresses UK brings together data about the places where people live, work and visit. In time, it will become the first UK address list published as open data and available for everyone to use without restriction. The list will combine information from existing open data sources with material provided directly by people about the addresses that they know. You can open up an address on the [website](https://openaddressesuk.org/) or find out more about about Open Addresses and its work so far on the [blog](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/blog).

Open Data Camp is a new two-day, weekend event, entirely devoted to Open Data. It follows the model of other successful conferences such as [UKGovCamp](http://www.ukgovcamp.com/), [LocalGovCamp](http://localgovdigital.info/localgovcamp/) and [BluelightCamp](http://bluelightcamp.org.uk/). The event is volunteer led, is free to attend, and is funded entirely by sponsorship. It’s held at a weekend, and participants are attending in their own time and at their own expense. This means that - unlike many traditional conferences - attendees are genuinely interested and enthusiastic.

Both Open Addresses UK and Open Data Camp are firsts for the UK: the first open UK address list and the first [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) dedicated to open data.

Peter Wells from Open Addresses UK said “Open Addresses UK is a ‘by the people, for the people’ project. Its future depends on everyone getting involved. Open Data Camp is a great opportunity for us to work with and contribute back to the open data community who have been working with us to develop and maintain a sustainable UK address list, one which is open to all and that benefits everyone.” 

Mark Braggins of Open Data Camp said “We are delighted to welcome Open Addresses UK as a main sponsor of Open Data Camp, and hope there will be lots of sessions which help move this hugely important and ground-breaking initiative forwards.“
