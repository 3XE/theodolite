Addresses are part of our everyday lives. But it’s not simple to locate addresses, to enter addresses on websites, or even to get access to an accurate list. We’re here to change that.

We are building services to meet the needs of service providers, community groups, the public sector and, most importantly, the people who live and work at those addresses.

Open Addresses is wholly owned by the not-for-profit [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/).

We have to create revenues to sustain our operations but will always make the bulk download available in full, for free as open data.

The current services have quality issues, for example it can take [months before new addresses are published and widely available for use](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/09/living-breathing-problem ) whilst urrent address services are too expensive meaning that there are many organisations and community groups that cannot afford to use them. We will fix these problems.

We gather and maintain data through a collaborative maintenance model that reduces costs whilst improving quality. Through this collaborative model everyone who donates data or uses our services is contributing to maintaining and improving a [public good](http://www.slideshare.net/JeniT/bcs-address-day-open-addresses-jeni-tennison ) from which we all benefit.

We determine and publish the [confidence that we have in each address](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) whilst our platform tracks the provenance of all of the data that it publishes. Address data in the UK is part of a complex legal and copyright puzzle so we need to publish [address data that is safe to use](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/26/making-address-data-safe).

We believe that we are the first open data projects to go to these lengths and we believe it is the right thing to do for such a fundamental part of the [UK’s National Information Infrastructure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure/national-information-infrastructure ).

There is a [rich history](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeni-tennison/a-brief-history-of-open-a_b_6485628.html?) of addresses in the UK, it’s time to write the next chapter.
