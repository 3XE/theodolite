title: There is an Alternative - Putting People in Control
---

This is the third in our blog series sharing what Open Addresses has learnt from discussions with both public sector organisations and users of public services.

* part 1 on new addresses can be found [here](/blog/2015/03/31/better-addresses-new-addresses)
* part 2 discussing online digital services can be found [here](/blog/2015/04/16/better-addresses-2)

In this blog we cover the topic of “alternative addresses”, otherwise known as “alias addresses”. A simple example is the old retail chain [Woolworths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group) with a shop which is known as both:

* ‘Unit 8, Big Shopping Centre, High Street’ and
* ‘Woolworths, Big Shopping Centre, High Street’

The first address (‘Unit 8...’) is the legal address whilst the second address (‘Woolworths...’) is the alternative address.

In our research we learnt more about why these alternative addresses exist, who uses them and how putting people in control of alternative addresses can lead to better services.

#### There is a legal address

There is a legal basis for addresses. Legislation requires people building new properties to inform their local authority that the property exists and request a number and street name that delivery services, emergency services, people and other organisations can identify and locate it. It is a legal requirement to clearly label a property to allow these services to physically identify and locate an address.

For the truly dedicated the legislation can be found here:

* England and Wales - [Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/10-11/34) and the [Public Health Act of 1925](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/71)
* Scotland - the [Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/45/section/97)
* Northern Ireland - [The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order (NI) 1995](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1995/759/contents)

The process for publishing these legal addresses is not perfect, for example the [speed of publishing new addresses is slower](/blog/2015/03/31/better-addresses-new-addresses) than people need, but in this article we want to discuss alternative addresses.

#### Alternative addresses have uses

Let’s go back to the Woolworths retail chain example with a shop known as: 

* ‘Unit 8, Big Shopping Centre, High Street’ and
* ‘Woolworths, Big Shopping Centre, High Street’

The first address is the legal address, it will have stayed the same even when the Woolworths store closed down and another chain moved in.

The second address, the alternative, was useful to the general public. If you, or I, had wanted to visit Woolworths to buy a bag of their famous [pic’n’mix](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7903509.stm) we would not have looked for a large sign saying ‘Unit 8’ we would have looked for the Woolworths logo.

Similarly if the emergency services were called to an incident then we suspect that the caller would have said that they needed the emergency services to come to Woolworths. We suspect that most emergency services staff would find it easier to locate Woolworths too.

This alternative address is easier for people to remember and locate than the legal address of ‘Unit 8’. 

#### For some people they are not seen as alternative

In Wales many addresses are identified in both Welsh and English languages. You can see some examples this extract from [Ordnance Survey Open Names](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-names.html):

Sometimes the Welsh address is first, sometimes it is the English. It depends on how the street was added to the list by the local authority.

In some cases people need to use the Welsh version of the address, in others they will need to use the English version. There are many people in Wales for whom [Welsh is their primary language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Wales) and who will communicate the Welsh form of the address. 

For a retail shop in Wales there may even be four versions of the address (Unit 8, Welsh; Unit 8 English; Woolworths, Welsh; Woolworths, English).

We have also heard of cases outside of Wales where roads are known by multiple names. Maybe because the name of a road changes along its length. Maybe because the physical street sign does not match the entry in the computerised address list. Maybe because people simply know it by another name.

There is a complex set of user needs being met by alternative addresses.

#### Windsor or Slough

Elsewhere we learnt that [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house), one of our current data sources, need to register addresses exactly as they are provided in company and director registration forms (for the legally curious the legislation is the [Companies Act 2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents)).

For their own reasons a company may choose to register its address in what they regard as a preferential location, one that better suits their business. Some companies register in Windsor even though the address is actually in Slough.

Companies have a legal right to do this but for other people that need to use the address it is incorrect. They may need to be able to discover another form of the address to deliver services to it.

Those businesses change their address because they think it will benefit their business whilst other people may choose to change the town or country in their address because of regional identity. To give just one example, some residents of the [City of Salford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salford,_Greater_Manchester) still declare that they live in Lancashire even though Salford has been in [Greater Manchester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester) since 1974.

#### Rose wants to live at Rose Cottage

Some people choose to name their home, to give it a personal address. The legal address might be “8 Acacia Avenue” but the person who lives there, let’s imagine that their name is Rose, chooses to call it “Rose Cottage”. 

<%= image_tag("blog/2015-04-28-jenny-stirling.jpg", alt: "Image by Jenny Stirling") %>

Despite it not being a legal address Rose may tell her friends that Rose Cottage is her address. Rose's friends may think that it is the correct address when they post a Christmas card or order a gift online.

This case may not have the same business needs as Woolworths, the same language needs as a Welsh speaker, or the same legal right as a company registration but Rose has chosen an alternative address for her home. That has a knock-on effect to the organisations that provide Rose with services.

Service providers need to know that that address might be called Rose Cottage. Without this knowledge a sale may be lost and a Christmas card or gift may not arrive because the address can’t be found.

#### Putting citizens in control will make addresses better

The following tweet was in response to our [blog post about Ordnance Survey open data](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/05/09/ordnance-survey-open-data) but it is also relevant to the issues discussed in this post.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Like playing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opendata?src=hash">#opendata</a> twister! Good <a href="https://twitter.com/openaddressesuk">@openaddressesuk</a>, let&#39;s put addresses back in the hands of citizens <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GE2015?src=hash">#GE2015</a> <a href="https://t.co/oklkblPjPw">https://t.co/oklkblPjPw</a></p>&mdash; Edafe Onerhime (@ekoner) <a href="https://twitter.com/ekoner/status/586411793456594944">April 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

Simply ignoring these alternative addresses will not make them disappear. We suspect that there will be increasing use of geographic addreses, such as the latitude and longitude that the map application in our smartphones can translate into a location, whilst startups like [What3Words](http://what3words.com/) are creating ever more ways of describing and locating addresses. What are these but alternative addresses?

Meanwhile alternative addresses are **needed** in many cases. We cannot expect people to use their legal address in every situation. Is the emergency services dispatcher going to ask a caller for Woolworths’ full address? Perhaps not.

Instead we should be more open to alternative addresses. There are benefits to listening to and learning from how people use addresses so that we can better meet user needs.

If we can build a model that supports alternative addresses as open data:

* a policeman can attend a call-out even if the caller reported Woolworths despite a new retail chain having moved into the same building
* a Welsh-language speaker can locate an address in an English-speaking part of Wales, and vice versa
* someone can enter a latitude and longitude or What3Words addresses and discover what postal addresses are near that point
* a company can report their address as being in Windsor yet still receive their post in Slough
* [Meals on wheels](https://meals-on-wheels.com/) or [Casserole Club](https://www.casseroleclub.com/) can find Rose at Rose Cottage
* the online retailer can receive an order for Rose Cottage and deliver the parcel to the correct postal address of 8 Acacia Avenue

At the moment these needs are being poorly met and services will fail.

Some address lists will not store the names of retail chains. Lists of Welsh addresses have patchy support for the Welsh-language. Companies House struggle to match their registered addresses to legal address. Whilst Rose will struggle to get anyone in authority to recognise that she has given a name to her home.

Organisations are in control, not the people they serve. Putting citizens in control of their addresses means service providers will find it easier to find and locate addresses. This supports the needs of both citizens and service providers, making addresses better.

#### Open and collaborative is the right way to support alternative addresses

We believe that an open and collaborative model, such as the one that Open Addresses is building, is the right way to support alternative addresses and the needs that they serve. 

Relying on formalised processes for people to register alternative addresses, or walking the streets to gather the information simply will not work: data collection is unreliable, the cost is high and new data is made available too slowly. That is why these needs are poorly met today.

Instead a collaborative model that learns from how people use addresses, and publishes the data with a [confidence score](/developers/confidence) will better meet these needs. A legal address might have a higher confidence score but some service providers will make the decision to choose to trust an alternative address.

We will be talking on this topic, and others, at a workshop hosted by the [Open Identity Exchange (OIX)](http://oixuk.org/) on [Wednesday 29th April](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oix-workshop-wednesday-29th-april-2015-tickets-16013440632). Why not come along to find out more ?

There is a great potential for improvement in UK addresses, let's put people in control.
