So, Open Addresses UK has [launched](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/news/2015/01/14/UKs-first-open-and-free-address-list-launches), and now you can start to see what we have been building over the last couple of months. We hope you like it.

But this is only the start. We know, and we are sure that you can see as well, that there is a lot of work left to do together to build an open address list; one that is efficient and fit for the times we live in, but also one that is fundamentally open and built collaboratively.

That is why we are gradually building our service in public through Alpha and Beta phases.

With this Alpha release we are continuing to gain greater understanding of the service and your needs, and we are testing and building new features that will help all of the people and organisations that use Open Addresses UK to work together to maintain the data.

Your feedback is an essential part of this process so keep sending it in.

Through the next weeks, based on a combination of your feedback and our own research, we will be gradually iterating to a stronger Beta release. Those iterations mean that things will change.

The changes might be the addition of more data, changes to the APIs or changes to the website. We might even have to take the platform down whilst we do upgrades. If you want to keep on top of what we're doing and be warned about planned upgrades, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openaddressesuk).

We’ve just finished planning our technology releases for the next two weeks. The [plans and roadmap are public](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/) but we thought it would be useful to give a simple summary.

In the fortnight starting today we plan to focus on the following (the numbers in brackets are for those who want to dive into the detailed features on the [roadmap](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/)):

+ Encrypting all communication with the website (13)
+ Releasing a free text interpreter that can handle the wide variety of address formats in the UK (15)
+ Starting automated publishing of address submissions (20, 56)
+ Opening up public APIs for submission and sample code to help people integrate the submission process into their own applications and websites (16, 17, 52)
+ Start publishing our plans and technical framework for providing confidence in the published data (3, 27)
+ Starting to publish our plans and technical framework for performing statistical inference algorithms to infer new address data based on known data (29, 32)

To put it even more simply these features will open a full loop for the automated publishing of addresses added through either our own or other organisation's websites.

In the fortnight starting 2 February our candidate features are the following (the numbers in brackets are for those who want to dive into the detailed features on the [roadmap](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/)):

+ Updating the current loaders with the capabilities developed in the previous sprint (18)
+ Providing sample code to help people integrate the search functions into their own applications and websites (27, 35)
+ Automating the process to quarantine data that is contaminated by third party intellectual property rights IPR (10, 25)
+ Adding the capability to provide attribution for people who submit addresses (51)
+ Making improvements to the website that will allow people to submit addresses in multiple languages, improve the user experience and provide some initial analytics and visualisations of the published data (14, 46, 47)
+ Opening up a validation API to allow people and organisations to provide information on whether data is good, bad or “it’s complicated” (22)
+ Improving the confidence and inference frameworks to support multiple sources of data (8, 30)
+ Providing sandbox capabilities so we, and you, can develop and trial imports of new data before publishing to the live platform (34)

Why not let us know which features are most important to you?

Alternatively maybe you want to work on either these, or other features yourself? Maybe you know of a great way to visualise the data? Or check it for quality?

[Our code, our data and the items that we are working on are all open](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) so feel free to dive in and contribute.

Alongside the activities above there will also be a series of blogs and articles to ask your input on some of the features and to answer some of the questions that are being raised on the [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openaddressesuk), and [in person](http://geomobldn.org/post/108249155865/2015-starts-off-well). There will also be a focus on continuing to [add more data to the platform](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/addingdata): through open data, through crowdsourced contributions and through integration with partners.

If you want to get involved by adding data, contributing to the platform and website development efforts, or by joining our list of organisations keen to start trialling integration with the platform then either [find out how to get involved](http://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/involved), contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openaddressesuk) or just [drop us an email](mailto:info@openaddressesuk.org).
