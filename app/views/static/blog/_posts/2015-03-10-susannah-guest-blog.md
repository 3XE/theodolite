*Winning photograph to Picture and Address photography competition, by Susannah Wheeler*

I’ve always loved photography, actually seeing something that catches my eye and capturing that moment in time.  More recently I’ve become more adept with some of the skills necessary to manipulate and enhance an image when I’ve got home, not to change the content, just to make it how I saw it.  I’m not in the habit of entering competitions, but when I saw the tweet about the launch of Open Addresses UK and the request for a photograph to represent what that meant to me, that image came to mind immediately and I sent it off – keeping an eye on my Twitter feed but not expecting to win it.
 
The brief for the competition was so broad and open that I had no idea what sort of image the judges would be looking for.  I’ve taken thousands of photographs, many of houses, rooftops and homes, but this one summed it up for me. To me, ‘open’ means accessible and ‘address’ is where we live. My address is where my home is, it doesn’t matter if it’s an apartment or a big house, it’s where my life and children are - it’s where my ‘stuff’ is.

I think the photograph I submitted sums up our diverse way of living in the 21st Century. This photo is actually an office block, with the vast windows reflecting the apartments opposite.  Many of those homes will also double up as offices.  As long as we have access to the internet which gives us the ability to communicate with other people so easily, it really doesn’t matter where we base ourselves for work nowadays.  It can be at home just as easily as a desk in a purpose built office building.
 
This image caught my eye in many different ways before I actually pushed the button on the camera; the light, the reflections and the many stories each window would tell if it could. Each time I look at it, I see something different.  From the flags displayed at the windows, to the colours and curtains.  As well as living and working in such close proximity, we also live in a multicultural society and we can see this diversity in our towns throughout the United Kingdom – especially in big cities where space is at a premium. 
 
There’s something very special about the way the reflections trick your eye for a moment or two.  It’s the sort of image that makes you look again – those are my favourites; ones where it’s not immediately obvious what the subject is in the photograph, but it makes you want to look more closely and work it out.
 
I am absolutely thrilled to have won the competition.  My love and enthusiasm for photography grows each day – just like my grin has since I found out that I had won!
