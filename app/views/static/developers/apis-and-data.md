The Open Addresses platform exposes many small APIs to allow people and organisations to retrieve data from the platform, to build their own services, and to collaboratively maintain the data that the platform publishes.

All of our own services are built on top of these APIs and all of our [code is open-source](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) under the terms of the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Anyone can contribute to or use the code.

The APIs are still in development but currently available to be freely used by anyone. We'd love your feedback so give them a try.

What do you want to do?

* [Simply download the dataset](/developers/download)
* [Parse an address](/developers/sortingoffice)
* [Search for an address(es) that match(es) certain criteria](/developers/search)
* [Submit a single address](/developers/submitone)
* [Submit a large quantity of addresses](/developers/submitmany)
* [Learn how confident we are in an address](/developers/confidence)
* [Attempt to infer the existence of addresses](/developers/inference)
* [Validate an address](/developers/validation)

If you didnâ€™t find a feature or API that you need then do let us know either on the [forums](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum) or on the [roadmap](https://huboard.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/#/) and we will see what we can do.

If you want to assist us by contributing to a roadmap issue then we regularly [tag issues that the community can help us with](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/labels/can%20be%20done%20by%20community).

Do remember that we are still in development so be gentle with us and the APIs. If you do find a bug then we are very sorry.

[Let us know](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum) or [suggest a fix via a pull request](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) and we will get it sorted as soon as we can.
