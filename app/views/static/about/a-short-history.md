title: A short history of addresses
---

There is a rich history in UK addresses dating back to the 11th Century, evolving with changing societal needs and rise of the internet. 

Early records show messengers were appointed by Henry I in the 12th Century to deliver letters to Government. By 1635 Charles I opened the UK’s first national postal service and over 300 years later the first postcodes were introduced with mechanical sorting systems to increase delivery efficiency. 

Most recently, technology has played a part in developing addresses. In 2011 GeoPlace formed as the UK’s central resource for spacial address and street information management, whilst geo mapping services power our mobile GPS navigation systems getting us from A to B with ease.

##Postal addresses so far have stood the test of time.

With buildings fallen during world wars and fires such as the Great Fire of London devastating skylines the original address has often remained even after new buildings replace them. We also savour addresses we’d like to remember. Commemorative blue plaques across the UK identify addresses of cultural heritage. Such as, Jimi Hendrix’ London home (23 Brook Street), Sir Michael Redgrave’s Bristol birth place (4 Horfield Road), and Sir Isaac Newton’s home, marking the beginnings of his theory of gravity (87 Jermyn Street, St James’ Place), these plaques are engrained in our neighbourhoods.

##Our needs are changing

Open Addresses is closing the gap between physical addresses and digital needs as we embrace new and improved digital services.

Here we map the historical path of UK addresses and the growth of digital addresses.
