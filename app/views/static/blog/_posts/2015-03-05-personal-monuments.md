title: Picture an Address - Personal monuments
---

It’s almost crunch time! ‘Personal Monuments’ is the last of our [Picture an Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address) shortlist themes. We’re shifting our attention to entries that move away from the conventional building to other objects and monuments.

Unfortunately, it’s difficult to accurately locate public monuments using the postcode system alone. Postcodes were initially designed to aid the postal service in delivering letters to addresses (that’s a location with a letterbox). Although [bridges might appear on postage stamps](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-31729166) we’re pretty sure that [very few of them](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-24028902) have a letterbox for incoming mail, making it slightly harder to pinpoint monuments of interest to the public.

For example, ever tried to search on a navigation device for your favourite burrito food stall, or a position along [a nature trail using a postcode](http://www.go4awalk.com/walks/ukpostcodewalks.php?postcode=LL19)? You’ll find the results are usually close but not precise. This is because a postcode can only describe a localised area and doesn’t pinpoint a position. Imagine how much easier tourism would be if we never needed to ask for directions? The world may be a happier place.

With this in mind, we’ve showcased the photos that represent personal or unofficial places of interest that people may hold dear to their hearts.

#### The shortlist for this theme is…
