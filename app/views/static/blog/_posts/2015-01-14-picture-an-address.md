Fancy yourself a dab hand with a camera, an outside the box thinker, or, quite simply, someone that loves a challenge? 

WE NEED YOU!

Open Addresses UK is a  first, and we’re sure like us, you love to be involved with projects that push the innovation boundaries. That’s exactly what we’re inviting you to do as part of Picture an Address - a FREE photography competition we are running to mark the launch of this exciting new project with a £500 vouchers for photography equipment up for grabs for the winning entry! 

What is Open Addresses UK you might ask? Well, it’s the UK’s first open address list and it’s important for us all - you can read more about it at [openaddressesuk.org](http://www.openadresssesuk.org) and even take part by uploading your own address at the same time.  

The potential for this project knows no bounds, anything is possible. And just like an address can open up so many different doors (no pun intended) we want to open up as many photographic possibilities as we can with this competition. 

So we would like you to sum up, in a photograph, what an address means to you. Sure, an address can be represented by a mailbox, a picture of a house, a row of properties or a view of a street through a long-lens. But we’re sure that as you imagine it, it can be so much more than that. What, exactly? That’s up to YOU! 

#### Entry details 

Entries will be accepted from 00:01 on Wednesday 14 January 2015 to 17:00 on Wednesday 4 February 2015 

How to submit your photograph? We’re a fan of keeping our options open, so we’re giving you a couple of ways to submit your masterpiece:

1) Email your photograph to [photocompetition@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:photocompetition@openaddressesuk.org) (please ensure your photographs are under 10 megabytes so they don’t bounce back!)
2) Send a link to your photograph to our twitter account [@openaddressesuk](https://www.twitter.com/openaddressesuk) with the hashtag #photoaddressesuk

The winning photograph will be selected by our panel of judges that includes the renowned photographer, Paul Clarke who says: "photos catch a moment, an emotion, a place. Addresses give those places a label. What happens when you get creative in using one to tell the story of the other? I'm very much looking forward to finding out".

The competition winner will be announced at an event in late February. More details on that will be announced soon.
