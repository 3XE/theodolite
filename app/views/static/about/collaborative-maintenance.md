title: Collaborative Maintenance

Collaboration is at the core of Open Addresses. Our services are designed to meet the needs of both users and service providers whilst working closely with them to improve user experience. We are building **Collaborative Maintenance Model** that reduces costs whilst improving the quality of address data.

Our model provides users with simple, affordable and accurate address services and service providers with cheaper, more intelligent services than current offerings.

Collaborative maintenance means that we gather data as our address services are used. The model enables us to learn and publish new address information (such as [alternative addresses](/blog/2015/04/28/better-addresses-3), new roads, addresses and post codes) as people start to use them, this increases the speed of publishing [new addresses](/blog/2015/03/31/better-addresses-new-addresses) and improves data quality. The data is then maintained by the community, anyone can say whether an address is [good or bad](/developers/validation). We openly publish [confidence](/developers/confidence) for each address. This score allows users to decide on how much to trust the data and evaluate the risk of using it. The [data, algorithms and code are open](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) allowing our community of users to easily assess, contribute and use it.

The whole model is a feedback loop for address data.

This model automates what was previously a manual task, improving address data maintenance making services that are reliable and affordable.
