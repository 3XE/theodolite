#### BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT sponsors the UK’s first open address list

*The BCS LISG Digital National Framework funds Open Addresses and Unique Property Reference Numbers open data enrichment research*

The nation’s first open data address company, [Open Addresses UK](https://openaddressesuk.org) today announces funding donated by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT’s Location Information Specialist Group’s (BCS LISG) [Digital National Framework](http://www.dnf.org/). The funding will assist in developing open address data for a better connected nation of addresses.

Open Addresses gathers, publishes and maintains a list of addresses, published as open data and free for everyone to use, with supporting services that make address data easier and simpler to use. The BCS LISG Digital National Framework (DNF) subgroup funds Open Addresses’ mission to provide improved accurate, affordable and accessible address data to new audiences. 

#### Location and address data integration

Open Addresses will explore the integration of its address data and Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) which [can now be published in open data](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/uprn-release-sharing-location-data.html). Upholding DNF principles to encourage location-based information sharing and integration for reliable business services, Open Addresses will support UPRN data in its services. The funding will also enable the development and expansion of Open Addresses address data, unique address URLs and location-based API services.

#### Funding for Beta phase

This is the first donation Open Addresses has received as it shifts into the next phase of development. Future sponsorship work will enable further development of existing Alpha services ready for Beta and the launch of new services beneficial to UK businesses, local authorities and communities that need accessible address information.

The Cabinet Office was the first to fund Open Addresses’ work, in December 2014. The Release of Data Fund grant awarded acknowledged open address data as a fundamental part of its National Information Infrastructure. The first four months of operations has achieved an address list of 1 million and a growing community across the nation working together to establish address data that serves a public good.

Jeni Tennison, Executive Director at Open Addresses said,

“We’re delighted to receive this landmark funding from the British Computer Society. As our first funding beyond our initial Cabinet Office grant, this support is a demonstration of the wide interest in open address data. Addresses are a vital part of the nation’s information infrastructure. This funding will help promote the use of a common code for each address, enabling people to match and bring data together and to create better services that we can all benefit from.”

Dan Rickman, Chair of the BCS LIS Group said,

“The recent Ordnance Survey announcement that Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) are to be made open data has enabled the BCS LISG to sponsor Open Addresses to apply DNF principles”.
