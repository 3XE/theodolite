We can’t believe we’re finally here!

We launched the ‘Picture an Address’ photography competition to support our vision in creating an up to date and free to use open data address list. The entries have been amazing, and the judges were really impressed with the creativity and skill used to show what an address means to you.

25 photographs made it through to the long-list selected by our panel of judges, Paul Clarke, Roger Highfield and Jeni Tennison. 6 made it to the final stage. Now one person will be winning £500 of photography vouchers and have their winning photo take pride of place on the main Open Addresses UK homepage and shared with our community.

###So without further delay a huge congratulations to *drumroll*...

_Susannah Wheeler_ for her winning photograph! Susannah’s photograph captures the rich heritage of Britain’s addresses, exhibiting two juxtaposed pieces of architecture observed through a reflection. Our judges thought your photograph really captured the essence of an addresses and were the most impressed with the creative use of reflecting to buildings against each other. It showed great skill, creativity and awareness of the variety of addresses we share in the UK. Well done Susannah!

##Creating awareness

The photographs submitted have given us a wide perspective of how an address interacts with its surroundings, carries emotional currency and what makes an address important to you. With your creativity we’ve been able to unlock key themes that illuminate some of the challenges we’ll seek to overcome with our open addresses list:

* [Natural escapes](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/03/natural-escapes) - Ensuring rural addresses have national prominence and accuracy
* [Diverse Architecture](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/03/diverse-architecture) - Creating confident address information for all types of residences
* [Through the Keyhole](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/04/through-the-keyhole) - Nurturing trust with individuals to encourage address data sharing
* [Communities](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/05/communities-shortlist) - Mobilising address data benefactors for community cohesion
* [Personal Monuments](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/05/personal-monuments) - Bringing people closer to addresses beyond buildings

##Here’s what our judges have to say...

Judge, Paul Clarke, commented:

> “A very open brief is sometimes the hardest sort to judge. I enjoyed seeing how many ways the sense of "openness" was conveyed - from amazing use of space and mirrors, to the sweeping beauty of untouched landscapes. An address is more than a house, or a building: it's not just a label for a place, but the situation of that place in its wider context. Well done to all who played with those concepts - some marvellous work.”

Jeni Tennison, chair of the judges and Director of Open Addresses UK

> “We’re developing an open list of addresses that brings together the physical and digital environments we live and work in. We still have lots to do and need people to work together to create this public good.  We hope the critical eye of photographers can demystify open addresses by demonstrating the variety and complexity of something that we all take for granted.”

###Thank you, thank you, thank you…
