title: Picture an Address - Communities shortlist
---

We’re delighted to announce the fourth shortlist of our [Picture an Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address). The previous theme, 'Through the keyhole', takes a close look inside of an address. Our latest theme, 'Communities' takes a broader approach, acknowledging the communities addresses are situated in.

Analysing the benefits addresses may have on a community is of particular interest to us at Open Addresses UK. An address rarely sits in isolation, and is most often connected to a wider network of 'addresses', much like the people connected within a local community. Merging the digital and physical world of addresses can play a significant part in community cohesion and local services.

For example:
- Combining [flood risk data](http://www.checkmyfloodrisk.co.uk/) with an accurate list of addresses would help local authorities provide weather warnings and prevention methods to high-risk addresses
- Assisting visitors to accurately locate new properties using [satellite navigation devices](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/8961133/Why-wont-satnavs-recognise-my-house.html)
- Providing internet service providers better information on [where their services are needed](https://keepup.virginmedia.com/cablemystreet)
- Creating a map of addresses within a sought-after [school catchment area](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/online-catchment-area-map-reveals-your-childs-chance-of-a-school-place-8926273.html)
- Supporting better [town planning](http://geolytix.co.uk/)

When an address is accurately identified within a community it can begin to provide invaluable information to its members, local authorities, organisations and the wider economy. If we’re able to access a complete and up to date list of addresses, the community advantages would be endless. This shortlist of entries, celebrates the diversity of the communities we live in.

#### Thank you to our shortlist...
