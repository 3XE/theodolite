Our search API is at [https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json](https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json)

Simply specify the street, town and postcode arguments on the querystring.

* [https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?street=camberwell](https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?street=camberwell)
* [https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?town=cheltenham](https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?town=cheltenham)
* [https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?postcode=se58qz](https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses.json?postcode=se58qz)

Partial search strings and multiple arguments are supported.

The response will provide you with all of the data matching your search terms including a persistent URL for each address, the addresses themselves in a format similar to the [British Standards Institute BS7666 standard](http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2006/7/Standardize-the-referencing-and-addressing-of-geographical-objects/#.VOxowLDkfp4), and the geographic centre of each address's postcode in latitude and longitude.

If you donâ€™t fancy playing around with JSON but want to see how this API works then simply visit our [search page](https://openaddressesuk.org/addresses). Our website is built on our APIs.
