title: Open Addresses UK Announces Photography Competition Winner - Susannah Wheeler
---

The UK’s first open and accessible address list, Open Addresses UK, today unveils the results of its photography competition, conveying personal interpretations of an address in one image.

The winning photograph is by Susannah Wheeler, who wins a £500 prize for her photographic interpretation of the diverse and complex address landscape of Britain. The photograph captures the rich heritage of Britain’s addresses, exhibiting two juxtaposed pieces of architecture observed through a reflection. Susannah’s photograph will now be used to help communicate open addresses to a wider community, in support of Open Addresses UK’s wider agenda. It takes pride of place as the main homepage image on opendaddressesuk.org from today.

Susannah Wheeler, photography competition winner, said:

"As soon as I saw the tweet about the competition I knew that was the photo I wanted to enter.  I think it sums up our diverse way of living in the 21st Century. Offices, homes and apartments are all so close together, sharing addresses in a way that we haven’t seen before.

Each time I look at it, I see something different; the light, the reflections and the many stories each window would tell if it could. My love and enthusiasm for photography grows each day and I am absolutely thrilled to have won the competition."

###Creating awareness

The photography competition supports the organisation’s vision to create an up to date and free to use open data address list. 25 photographs made it through to the long-list, seen by a panel of judges comprising: renowned photographer, Paul Clarke, the Science Museum’s Director of Science affairs, Roger Highfield and Open Addresses UK Director Jeni Tennison.

The nominated photographs provided a wide perspective of how an address interacts with its surroundings, carries emotional currency and is perceived by the public. The competition revealed themes that illuminate some of the challenges Open Addresses will seek to overcome:

* [Natural escapes](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/03/natural-escapes) - Ensuring rural addresses have national prominence and accuracy
* [Diverse Architecture](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/03/diverse-architecture) - Creating confident address information for all types of residences
* [Through the Keyhole](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/04/through-the-keyhole) - Nurturing trust with individuals to encourage address data sharing
* [Communities](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/05/communities-shortlist) - Mobilising address data benefactors for community cohesion
* [Personal Monuments](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/03/05/personal-monuments) - Bringing people closer to addresses beyond buildings

Jeni Tennison, chair of the judges and Director of Open Addresses UK said:

> “We’re developing an open list of addresses that brings together the physical and digital environments we live and work in. We still have lots to do and need people to work together to create this public good.  We hope the critical eye of photographers can demystify open addresses by demonstrating the variety and complexity of something that we all take for granted.”

###Judging the campaign

Each photograph was anonymously assessed on imaginative concepts, measuring: openness, tone, originality, composition and conceptual narrative. Finalists were revealed this week on the Open Addresses UK website and Twitter.

Judge, Paul Clarke, commented:

> “A very open brief is sometimes the hardest sort to judge. I enjoyed seeing how many ways the sense of "openness" was conveyed - from amazing use of space and mirrors, to the sweeping beauty of untouched landscapes. An address is more than a house, or a building: it's not just a label for a place, but the situation of that place in its wider context. I was impressed to see those that played with those concepts.”
