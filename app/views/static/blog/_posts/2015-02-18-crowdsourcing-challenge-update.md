title: Crowdsourcing Challenge: Delay and Answers
--- 

When we launched our [crowdsourcing challenge](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/22/crowdsourcing-challenge) we invited potential bidders to ask us questions. You will find a table below summarising the ones that we were asked and the answers that we gave.

Two things were clear from the questions:

A number of potential bidders were confused about the copyright and licensing issue. Don’t worry so are many people, that’s why one of our aims is to [making UK addresses safe to use](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/26/making-address-data-safe).
We may not have been clear enough with our language on inference and confidence. We published a blog on [inference](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/12/inference) last week and will shortly be publishing a blog on confidence

In addition we also realised that [Open Data Camp](http://odcamp.org.uk/) would be a great place to collaborate with the community but a slight distraction from assessing responses...

Given this we have decided to extend the deadline for proposals by one week to Thursday 25 February.

This doesn’t mean that we are asking people to do extra work in their proposals, simply that you have a little more time to understand the challenge. UK address data is a complex challenge, that is why we want to work with people like yourselves to make it simple enough that we can mobilise a crowd to help us fix it.

#### Answers to questions


|:Question:|:Answer:|
|--------------------|---------------------|
|:Would it be possible for two bidders to win £20k each?|:If we received two bids of £20,000 which met our criteria then we would consider them the same as any other bid.|
|:We are great at building tools but less good at building a crowd. Can we use your communications team to help us?|:We do have a great communications team but would obviously need to plan for the extra effort. Please include in your proposal a description of the type and amount of help that you expect to need.|
|:We follow an agile process. Would the £40k be a Minimum Viable Product or the final solution?|:If we can demonstrate success then this could be a Minimum Viable Product that scales, but it needs to add confidence or new addresses from the outset.|
|:Are you a business, a social enterprise or a charity?|:We are a limited company that is wholly owned by the Open Data Institute (the ODI). The ODI is a plc established as a [not-for-profit](http://theodi.org/faq).|
|:Do you have relationships with Google, Ordnance Survey, OpenStreetMap or other mapping providers? We might want to use them in our proposal.|:We know many mapping providers and can assist with introductions if necessary. Do remember that the final addresses need to be able to be released under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence.|
|:Can we partner with a public sector organisation and use their existing address datasets to drive a crowd to cleanse and add confidence to address data?|:Yes, but you would need to be careful to ensure that the resulting dataset can be released under the CC-BY-4.- licence. Many of the existing public sector datasets contain third party address data which the public sector can use under the terms of the Public Sector Mapping Agreement ([PSMA](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/public-sector/mapping-agreements/)) but which may not be releasable as Open Data. See our blog [Making Address Data Safe To Use](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/26/making-address-data-safe) for more detail.|
|:Can we award prizes for finding addresses?|:Yes, although virtual prizes might make sense as otherwise whoever delivers the prize might as well validate the address! Please be clear as to whether the cost for this is in your proposal or whether you would expect this to come from Open Addresses budget. In the latter case please provide a cost so that it can be factored into our decision-making process|
|:How does your inference work?|:See our blog on how we [multiply addresses](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/12/inference).|
|:How does your confidence algorithm work?|:We will be publishing a blog shortly.|
|:Is there a chance that no bidder wins?|:Yes, our initial funding comes from the Government which ultimately means it comes from all of us. We do like to be careful with it.|
|:If you are funded by Government does that mean I need to do a lengthy, detailed, proposal?|:No! We follow the ODI procurement rules; recognise the challenges of juggling priorities/opportunities in small organisations; and like to keep things simple and flexible. Just answer the points in our first post on the challenge.|
|:We are concerned that our first idea might not take off. Can we propose a framework which would allow multiple ideas to be trialled?|:Absolutely!|
