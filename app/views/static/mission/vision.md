		<h1>Our Vision</h1>
		<p>Making UK address data better for everyone.</p>
	</div>
</div>

Addresses are part of our everyday lives. They pinpoint where we live, work and visit, connecting us to local communities and services we rely on. There is a hidden complexity and cost in the process of locating addresses, entering addresses online, and  accessing an accurate address list. We’re here to change this, to make things simpler and better.

#### What we are creating

Together with a growing network of contributors we’re building the UK’s first free and open address list: a list that is available for anyone to access, use and share as open data.

We’re creating services that will improve the way we use addresses, meeting the needs of developers and, most importantly, those of the people and communities who live and work at UK addresses.

Since launching our Alpha services in January 2015 we have begun to unlock the full potential to improve addresses in the UK. We have seen wide interest amongst local authorities, companies and individuals; we have shaped our services as a response to their valuable feedback.

Open Addresses will provide high quality data and services that are both affordable and sustainable. It will make UK address data better for everyone.

#### The problem we are solving and the benefits we create

Address services available today can be expensive to use: many organisations, particularly smaller ones, simply can’t afford them. And even when they can afford to access them, restrictive terms limit what organisations can do with them.

Meanwhile the quality is inconsistent, it can take months to make new addresses visible leaving [the people who live or work there unable to get the services they need](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/09/living-breathing-problem).

Solving these problems will create [many benefits](/get-involved/sponsors#benefits) - for both now and the future. It's time to bring addresses into the digital age.

#### Building an open and collaborative culture

Collaboration and openness is the core of everything we do. We are open by default. Our [source code](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK) and [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/roadmap/issues) are open and we invite everyone to contribute to and use our data, and [share feedback](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/forum). 

With the help of this growing community we are building a collaborative model to maintain quality address data.

#### Raising confidence in address data 

We understand the importance of having accurate addresses. We track where our address data comes from and openly publish a calculated [level of confidence for each address](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) so others can make informed decisions about the addresses they choose to use.

We believe that we are the first open data organisation to track provenance and publish confidence from the start. We know that UK address data is part of a complex legal and copyright puzzle so need to publish [address data that you can be sure is safe to use](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/26/making-address-data-safe).

#### Maintaining a public good

We believe addresses are a fundamental part of the [UK’s National Information Infrastructure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure/national-information-infrastructure) and should be open for all to benefit from and contribute to.

Everyone who uses Open Addresses’ services, or who uses services that are built on top of the Open Addresses platform, becomes part of this community. When people, apps and websites use the services it allows the platform to learn about bad data, to learn how much to [trust addresses](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) or to discover new addresses. This approach reduces costs and improves data quality. It helps turn what was an expensively maintained asset into a [public good](http://www.slideshare.net/JeniT/bcs-address-day-open-addresses-jeni-tennison) that is maintained using collaboration, cross-subsidy and voluntary effort.

#### Overcoming new challenges 

There’s still much to do.

We'd like to expand our current services and develop new ones, increase our address list, sign up new [trialists](/get-involved/trialists), grow our community and secure further [sponsorship](/get-involved/sponsors) to bring all our services into Beta.

Open Addresses is wholly owned by the not-for-profit [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/). We have to create revenues and sponsorship to sustain our operations but we will always make the bulk address data available to download in full, for free, as open data.

#### Let’s make history

There is a [rich history](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jeni-tennison/a-brief-history-of-open-a_b_6485628.html?) of addresses in the UK. Let's write the next chapter together.
