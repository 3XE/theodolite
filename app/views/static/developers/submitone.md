title: Submit a single addresses

If you want to submit a single, or a small quantity of addresses, then the Sorting Office API can do this for you.

Simply set the 'Contribute' argument described in the documentation: [https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#how-to-use](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#how-to-use).

By submitting addresses you, or your organisation contributes to the platform and every user can benefit. If you choose to build Sorting Office into your user journey to help simplify your own work then why not contribute back to the community by submitting the resulting addresses to the platform?

If you do choose to submit addresses in this way then please read and adhere to the [Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/OpenAddressesUK/sorting_office#subguidelines) and ensure that your site's terms and conditions provide appropriate information to your users.
