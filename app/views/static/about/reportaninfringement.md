We want users of the data we publish to be confident that they can use it for any purpose. Our users need to know our data does not infringe anyone’s Intellectual Property (IP) rights so they know it is safe to use.

If any person or organisations believes that their IP rights have been infringed then they should submit an infringement notice to us. This page allows interested parties to see details of the infringement notices that we have received, find out how to submit an infringement notice, and understand how we will process them.

As with many of our processes and services we expect this page to change and develop over time. Do send us your feedback and suggestions on how to improve this page to meet your needs.

#### Open data on infringement notices

The following table shows how many infringement notices we have received. We operate openly and will publish as much detail as we can of any infringement notices that we receive. 

Total number of infringement notices received to date - 0.

#### Submit an infringement notice

If you think that some of your or your organisation’s Intellectual Property has been published through the Open Addresses UK platform without authorization then you can send us an infringement notice. These requests should only be submitted by, or with the authority of, the owner of that Intellectual Property right or someone (such as an exclusive licensee) with a right to enforce that right.

Please do not make false claims if you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notice. Misuse of this process damages us, our users and copyright owners that are looking to protect their rights. Knowingly making a false claim may amount to fraud.

To submit a request please send an email to [notices@openaddressesuk.org](mailto:notices@openaddressesuk.org?subject=Infringement%20notice) with “Infringement notice” in the subject line or write to us at Open Addresses Limited c/o BPE Solicitors LLP, St James' House, St James Square, Cheltenham, GL50 3PR with the following information:

+ contact information (name, organisation - if applicable, phone number, email address, physical address)
+ a complete description of the work that you believe has been infringed
+ the specific URLs of each [address and/or downloadable dataset](https://openaddressesuk.org/data) which you believe infringes your rights and the date and time they were observed
+ a complete description of the right or rights you claim and in what way you believe those rights are infringed by our actions
+ our address data can come from multiple sources: if it is possible please state which source you believe introduced the copyright infringement
+ a statement confirming that you are, or are authorised to act on behalf of, a person who may enforce the rights you have described; believe in good faith that the use is not authorised; and that the information in your infringement notice is accurate

We operate on as open a basis as possible and will publish details of the infringement notice, with the exception of contact information, so that our users are aware of any issues which may make the data not safe to use.

At a minimum we will publish the name of the work; the impacted data; and a description of your claim. 

#### How we process infringement notices

We will process infringement notices promptly and in good faith.

If you have not received an acknowledgement within one working day, then please escalate to any of the named team members.

When we receive an infringement notice we will, within a reasonable timeframe, assess the information and if we conclude that there is any infringing data in our published datasets we will remove it.

The address data published by the platform comes from multiple sources. Removing one source or a subset of data infringing Intellectual Property rights will not necessarily remove any address records from the published dataset. Instead, it may change provenance information and alter confidence measures. 

We will also attempt to inform the user, or users, that submitted any infringing data of the infringement notice and the description of how the data is said to be an infringement of Intellectual Property rights. We will use any information they provide as part of our decision-making process and will normally share that information with the person who submitted the infringement notice.
