title: Picture an Address - Diverse Architecture Shortlist
---

We’re pleased to announce the second shortlist of our [Picture an Address photography competition](https://openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/01/14/picture-an-address). This time the theme of focus is ‘Diverse Architecture’. What is diverse architecture you ask? Take a look around you, how many different building styles can you see? You are witnessing diverse architecture.

Methods to record addresses have evolved over time and so have the buildings that give them a physical form. The emergence of new building materials, techniques and architectural trends are prevalent in architectural design around the world, however the most significant influence of this aesthetic architectural variety (or diverse architecture) is the effect of post-war regeneration in Britain.

[2.5 million people](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/history/scotland_britain_1880_now/housing/revision/3/) were rehoused into newly built properties during post WWII regeneration efforts, with cities experiencing the most dramatic makeovers. During this time a huge number of new addresses were formed. Many post-war buildings were later knocked down and rebuilt to provide more efficient living spaces as communities evolved. As part of our recent research into how much we could [trust address data](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/02/20/confidence) we  calculated that the half-life of a postcode in the UK is only [23.6 years](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1955JNRhDGMckIRObgS-9cEduY5p6cX6fKMjY-peSE8Q/edit?usp=sharing), closely related to the level of building regeneration carried out during the second half of the 20th century. 
 
We found this a fascinating fact about the nature of UK addresses and the forms that they take, influenced by regeneration and housing demands as the UK population continues to grow. Our shortlisted entrants positively capture the architectural evolution of addresses within the places that we live, work and visit. 

Without further ado, the shortlist nominees are…

A special thank you to Barry Tennison, @photography.uk, Anke Holst and Eleanor Whiteman for their imaginative photography capturing addresses in the context of architectural prominence.
