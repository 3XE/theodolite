<div class="content-meta">Article by Patrice John-Baptiste, on 3rd March '15</div>

We’re excited to announce our first shortlist and first finalist from our ‘Picture an Address’ photography competition. This shortlist celebrates the theme of ‘Natural Escapes’ as we picture addresses in rural areas of the UK.

The UK's countryside is a national treasure, home to an abundance of wildlife, 15 national parks and often inspired by famous authors behind the works of classical children’s storybooks and period novels.

Rural Britain is home to 9.9% of [the population](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/rural-population-percent-of-total-population-wb-data.html) and a favourite choice for city dwellers to escape from their bustling cityscapes.

Interestingly, 74.1% of households in rural locations are occupied in contrast to 61.2% in urban areas, and the average age of those residents are 8 years older (at 45) than our urban counterparts (at 37). So as some leave for the city, they may one day return to settle down later in life.

Our photography entrants vividly capture the charm of the countryside and what an address in rural Britain means to them. From tranquil meadows, to willow trees and a rustic barn, the addresses captured sits in harmony with its quiet surroundings, representing an address that extends beyond a building of habitation.
